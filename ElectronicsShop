//A person wants to determine the most expensive computer keyboard and USB drive that can be purchased with a give budget. Given price lists for keyboards and USB drives and a budget, find the cost to buy them. If it is not possible to buy both items, return .

//Example
//b = 60
//keyboards = 40 50 60
//drives = 5 8 12

//The person can buy a 40 keyboard + 12 drive = 52, or a 50 keyboard + a 8 drive = 58. Choose the latter as the more expensive option and return 58 .

//Function Description

//Complete the getMoneySpent function in the editor below.

//getMoneySpent has the following parameter(s):

//int keyboards[n]: the keyboard prices
//int drives[m]: the drive prices
//int b: the budget
//Returns

//int: the maximum that can be spent, or -1 if it is not possible to buy both items
