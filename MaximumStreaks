//A coin was tossed numerous times. You need to find the longest streak of tosses resulting  and the longest streak of tosses resulting in .

//Complete the function getMaxStreaks which takes an array of strings toss and returns an array of two integers denoting the maximum streaks of  and  respectively.

//Input Format

//In the first line, there is a single integer  denoting the number of tosses.

//Then,  lines follow. The  of them contains a string  denoting the result of the  toss of the coin.

//Constraints

//In a single line, print two space-separated integers denoting the maximum streak of Heads and the maximum streak of Tails respectively.
