//When a contiguous block of text is selected in a PDF viewer, the selection is highlighted with a blue rectangle. In this PDF viewer, each word is 
//highlighted independently. For example:

//There is a list of  character heights aligned by index to their letters. For example, 'a' is at index  and 'z' is at index . There will also be a string. 
//Using the letter heights given, determine the area of the rectangle highlight in  assuming all letters are  wide.

//Example
// h =[1 3 1 3 1 4 1 3 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5]
word = 'torn'

//The heights are t=0, o=1, r=1 and n=1. The tallest letter is 2 high and there are 4 letters. The hightlighted area will be 2*4 so the answer is 8.

//Function Description

//Complete the designerPdfViewer function in the editor below.

//designerPdfViewer has the following parameter(s):

//int h[26]: the heights of each letter
//string word: a string
//Returns

//int: the size of the highlighted area
//Input Format

//The first line contains 26 space-separated integers describing the respective heights of each consecutive lowercase English letter, ascii[a-z].
//The second line contains a single word consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters. The width of each letter is 1.

function designerPdfViewer(h, word) {
    // Write your code here
    var maxHeight = 1;
    for (let i = 0; i< word.length; i++){
        if (h[word.charCodeAt(i)-97] > maxHeight ){
            maxHeight = h[word.charCodeAt(i)-97]
        }
    }
    return maxHeight * word.length;

}
