//A video player plays a game in which the character competes in a hurdle race. Hurdles are of varying heights, and the characters have a maximum height 
//they can jump. There is a magic potion they can take that will increase their maximum jump height by  unit for each dose. How many doses of the potion 
//must the character take to be able to jump all of the hurdles. If the character can already clear all of the hurdles, return .

//Example
//k = [1,2,3,3,2]
//height = 1

//The character can jump 1 unit high initially and must take 2 doses of potion to be able to jump all of the hurdles.

//Function Description

//Complete the hurdleRace function in the editor below.

//hurdleRace has the following parameter(s):

//int k: the height the character can jump naturally
//int height[n]: the heights of each hurdle


function hurdleRace(height, k) {
    // Write your code here
    var potion = 0;
    var tempPotion = 0;
    console.log(k, height);
    for (let i =0; i<k.length; i++){
        
        if (k[i] > height){
            console.log(k[i]);
            tempPotion = k[i] - height;
            if (tempPotion > potion){
                potion = tempPotion;
            }
        }
    }
    return potion;
