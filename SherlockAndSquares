//Watson likes to challenge Sherlock's math ability. He will provide a starting and ending value that describe a range of integers, inclusive of the 
//endpoints. Sherlock must determine the number of square integers within that range.

//Note: A square integer is an integer which is the square of an integer, e.g.1,4,9,16,25 .

//Example
//a=24
//b=49

//There are three square integers in the range:25, 36  and 49. Return 3.

//Function Description

//Complete the squares function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the number of square integers in the inclusive range from a to b.

//squares has the following parameter(s):

//int a: the lower range boundary
//int b: the upper range boundary
//Returns

//int: the number of square integers in the range

function squares(a, b) {
    var count = 0;
    var plusNumber = 0;
    for (let i = a; i<b+1; i++){
        if (Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(i))){ // loop only runs long enough to find one square, then just once for each additional.
            count ++;
            i = i + (Math.sqrt(i)*2); // advances to next square to speed up loop
        }
    }
    return count;
}
