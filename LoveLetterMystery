//James found a love letter that his friend Harry has written to his girlfriend. James is a prankster, so he decides to meddle with the letter. 
//He changes all the words in the letter into palindromes.

//To do this, he follows two rules:

//He can only reduce the value of a letter by 1, i.e. he can change d to c, but he cannot change c to d or d to b.
//The letter  may not be reduced any further.
//Each reduction in the value of any letter is counted as a single operation. Find the minimum number of operations required to convert a given string 
//into a palindrome.

//Example
//s =cde

//The following two operations are performed: cde → cdd → cdc. Return .

//Function Description

//Complete the theLoveLetterMystery function in the editor below.

//theLoveLetterMystery has the following parameter(s):

//string s: the text of the letter
//Returns

//int: the minimum number of operations

function theLoveLetterMystery(str) {
    var count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor(str.length / 2); i++) {
    // Looping inwards from both sides.
    let leftChar = str[i];
    let rightChar = str[str.length - 1 - i];

    if (leftChar !== rightChar) {
      count = count + Math.abs((rightChar.charCodeAt(0) - 
      leftChar.charCodeAt(0)));
      console.log(rightChar, rightChar.charCodeAt(0),
      leftChar.charCodeAt(0), leftChar)
    }
  }
  return count;
