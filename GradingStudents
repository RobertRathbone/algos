//HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

//Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 1 to 100.
//Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
//Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grades according to these rules:

//If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
//If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.//Given the initial value of grades for each of Sam's  students, write code to automate the rounding process.

//Function Description

//Complete the function gradingStudents in the editor below.

//gradingStudents has the following parameter(s):

//int grades[n]: the grades before rounding
//Returns

//int[n]: the grades after rounding as appropriate
//Input Format
