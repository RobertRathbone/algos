//There is a string, s, of lowercase English letters that is repeated infinitely many times. Given an integer,n , find and print the number of letter a's 
//in the first  letters of the infinite string.

//Example
//s ='abcac'
//n = 10

//The substring we consider is abcacabcacac, the first 10 characters of the infinite string. There are 4 occurrences of a in the substring.

//Function Description

//Complete the repeatedString function in the editor below.

//repeatedString has the following parameter(s):

//s: a string to repeat
//n: the number of characters to consider
//Returns

//int: the frequency of a in the substring

function repeatedString(s, n) {
    // Write your code here
    var aCount =0;
    var totalA = 0;
    var extraA = 0;
    console.log(s,n, extraA)
    for (let i = 0; i<s.length; i++){
        if (s[i] == 'a'){
            aCount ++;
            if (i < n%s.length){
                extraA++
            }
        }
    }
    totalA = aCount*(Math.floor(n/s.length)) + extraA;
    return totalA
