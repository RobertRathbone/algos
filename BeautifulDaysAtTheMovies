//Lily likes to play games with integers. She has created a new game where she determines the difference between a number and its reverse. 
//For instance, given the number 12, its reverse is 21. Their difference is 9. The number 120 reversed is 21, and their difference is 99.

//She decides to apply her game to decision making. She will look at a numbered range of days and will only go to a movie on a beautiful day.

//Given a range of numbered days,[i..j]  and a number k, determine the number of days in the range that are beautiful. Beautiful numbers are defined as 
//numbers where i - reverse(i) is evenly divisible by k. If a day's value is a beautiful number, it is a beautiful day. Return the number of beautiful days in the range.

//Function Description

//Complete the beautifulDays function in the editor below.

//beautifulDays has the following parameter(s):

//int i: the starting day number
//int j: the ending day number
//int k: the divisor
//Returns

//int: the number of beautiful days in the range

function beautifulDays(i, j, k) {
    var stringOfNumber = "";
    var reversedNumber = "";
    var beautifulDayCount = 0;
    for (let count = i; count <= j; count ++){
        stringOfNumber = count.toString();
        // console.log(stringOfNumber)
        for (let j = stringOfNumber.length-1; j>= 0; j--){
            reversedNumber = reversedNumber + stringOfNumber[j]
        }
        // console.log ("count", count, "reversedNumber", reversedNumber, "k", k, ((count - parseInt(reversedNumber))%k))
        if ((count - parseInt(reversedNumber))%k ==0){
            beautifulDayCount++
        }
        reversedNumber = "";
    }
    return beautifulDayCount;
