//Two children, Lily and Ron, want to share a chocolate bar. Each of the squares has an integer on it.

//Lily decides to share a contiguous segment of the bar selected such that:

//The length of the segment matches Ron's birth month, and,
//The sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birth day.
//Determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.

//Example
// s = [2,2,3,1,2]
// d=4
// m=2

//Lily wants to find segments summing to Ron's birth day, 4 with a length equalling his birth month,2 . In this case, there are two segments meeting her 
//criteria:2,2  and 3,1 .
